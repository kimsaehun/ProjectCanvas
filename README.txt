Dance!: A girl has the power to dance and bring about the world's end. Help her dance by keeping the beat and directing her flow.

An incremental game. Start out with rhythmic tapping and as you progress you earn the ability to draw rather than tap. You can also perform combos to increase your production.
For now no rhythm. Just tapping plus purchases.

To start, lets take care of input. Lets start with a simple tap. When the inputs mousedown and mouseup occurs relatively consecutively in the relatively same area, it is considered to be a tap, and a music note is produced. Once the world detects an input, run that input by the rulebook and check if its a tap. If it is a tap, send the music note miniature to the world to output.

To start the to start, let start by drawing an image onto the screen.
